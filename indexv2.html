      The term Webilyn is a play on the last four letters of my name. 
      I've done this numerous times in both my Discord server, and my 
      mods in games. "Marial Garden Zone", "Kyokilyn", etc.

      I think I'll want the title to scroll, it'd look cool.
      Maybe I could pair the scrolling title with a cool favicon
      to make it inspired by the 2000s.
