      The term Webilyn is a play on the last four letters of my name. 
      I've done this numerous times in both my Discord server, and my 
      mods in games. "Marial Garden Zone", "Kyokilyn", etc.

      I think I'll want the title to scroll, it'd look cool.
      Maybe I could pair the scrolling title with a cool favicon
      to make it inspired by the 2000s.

        Hi, I'm <span style="color: peachpuff;">Marilyn</span>!<br>
        An intermediate programmer studying <span style="color: blue;">Lua</span>, <span style="color: orange;">HTML/CSS/JS</span>, <span style="color: blue;">C</span>, and many other programming languages.<br>
        <br>
        I got my start in 2016 when I got my hands on a Nintendo DSi XL, still one of my favorite consoles. It came with an application called Petit Computer, a simple BASIC sandbox with spriting, a simple syntax, and many examples to build off of. It forever changed me, and eventually got me into learning Lua so I could make mods for a game I enjoy, <span style="color: blue;">Sonic</span> <span style="color: grey;">Robo Blast</span> <span style="color: orange;">2</span>.<br><br>
        <span style="color: blue;">Sonic</span> <span style="color: grey;">Robo Blast</span> <span style="color: orange;">2</span> is a non-profit, community-made (but not ran :/) Sonic fangame that's been around since 1998, taking most of its ideas from the Sonic games of the era. Using my newfound Lua knowledge, I made my first add-on, <span style="color: blue;">QoL Sonic</span>. He's just Sonic with his Hyper form from <span style="color: goldenrod;">Sonic 3 & Knuckles</span>, alongside a homing attack, accelerative playstyle, and many niche additions. Unfortunately, he was never properly archived or preserved, so he's lost to time. My next project however would be much greater, and is probably why a few people actually knew me early on. <span style="color: grey;">Speccy's Dungeon Crawler</span>.<br><br>
        It was unfortunately never finished, never did reach v2, but it was pretty good for a simple multiplayer gamemode at its time. You and any amount of others would traverse user-created dungeon maps in search of items, and other goodies while leveling up using an RPG-like gameplay mechanic.<br><br>
        Fast forward a while, and I started getting into modeling, I wanted to make my OC, <span style="color: #373737;">Speccy the Kitsune</span>, as a model so I could make her an actual character in SRB2. I used Misfit Model 3D, a rather primitive modeling software, to make the model. Then I used an old rendering setup in Blender by fznmeatpopsicle to do the hard work. Fast forward just a little longer (not really, it was like, a month of many ideas), and <span style="color: #373737;">"Speccy!"</span> released on the SRB2 Message Board. She had RPG mechanics just like the dungeon crawler, but now it was tied to a specific character.<br><br>
        Destined to make something greater--mainly after she was accepted with mixed views--I started work on the modern design for <span style="color: #373737;">Speccy</span>, a true, three-tailed Kitsune with glasses. This mirrored how I looked in real life, except I was taller by a lot. After a few months of dedication, the new Speccy was received with mixed views at first, just like <span style="color: #373737;">"Speccy!"</span> (now <span style="color: #373737;">Legacy Speccy</span>), but people started to warm up to her, and me too. I was finally starting to build a presence in the SRB2 community as a respectable add-on developer, and a very ambitious one at that.<br><br>
        Between <span style="color: #373737;">Speccy</span> and <span style="color: #373737;">Legacy Speccy</span>, I tried to do a bit of story-building with <span style="color: #373737;">Speccy</span>, making projects such as <span style="color: #FF00FF;">Speccy Adventure</span>, and its sequel <span style="color: #FF00FF;">Speccy Adventure</span> <span style="color: goldenrod;">2</span>, yet neither saw the light of day.
