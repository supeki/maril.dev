        Those who know me on Discord should know that I've been ill with RSV, 
        (Respiratory System Virus) for the past 4-5 days. It's been pretty annoying
        but now I've reached a state that I can go back to school, so that's nice.
        <br><br>
        Anyways, this page has received a slight touch as you can see. I'm having a go
        at messing with CSS (Cascasing Style Sheets) again, hopefully it doesn't
        impact the visibility on my PDA.
        <br><br>
        EDIT: A PDA is a Pocket PC, I am not referring to the term "Public Display of Affection".

        Last night I checked my text messages to find that my girlfriend, 
        who shall not be named for privacy, had broke up with me. 
        This brought down my mood a bit, but I'm trying to remain neutral 
        to not put worry into others. As I'm typing this, I have started 
        work on making a blog page for <a href='https://maril.dev'>maril.dev</a>, in which 
        itself is still a placeholder.
        <br><br>
        EDIT:<br>
        I'm not sure how I'll handle making blog entries, as right now everything is done
        in raw HTML over at <a href="https://github.com/supeki/maril.dev">https://github.com/supeki/maril.dev</a>.<br>If you have any ideas, <a href="contacts.html">please get in contact with me.</a>
