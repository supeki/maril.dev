        Last night I checked my text messages to find that my girlfriend, 
        who shall not be named for privacy, had broke up with me. 
        This brought down my mood a bit, but I'm trying to remain neutral 
        to not put worry into others. As I'm typing this, I have started 
        work on making a blog page for <a href='https://maril.dev'>maril.dev</a>, in which 
        itself is still a placeholder.
