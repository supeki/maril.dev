        Tomorrow will mark the 15th or 16th year of my younger step-brother Aiden's life. I haven't seen him in a long while
        but I wish him well. I'll likely call him tomorrow, but I think I won't have much to say other than Happy Birthday.
        <br><br>
        Anyways, life has been going interesting, for better or worse. I've made a new Speccy model, which is based off my previous
        model, but now with a few optimizations and actual bendable tails and a better armature. I plan to use this
        model for any new projects of mine, as well as replacing the sprites in a few older projects. I would like to thank
        LonelyFoxz for teaching me this new stuff I used to make the model, including mirroring and symmetrization.
        <br><br>
        Lonely (or Foxz [?]) has also been helping with one of my larger projects, Robo Blast Online. A theoretical multiplayer
        RPG game based off Phantasy Star Online, being made in Sonic Robo Blast 2. He's made the model and animations for
        Sonic, including a unique sword design that looks similar to an emblem! So I have a lot of thanks to give to him
        as well as Bolt Zyphyr for helping contribute to the project. It wouldn't be anywhere without them, even if we've
        just started...
        <br><br>
        Here's an image of the new model, it's hosted on Discord, so if it disappears, let me know.<br>

        I've currently fallen behind in my studies in school, but I am slowly catching up.
        I'll need to stay away from Discord and Twitter long enough to actually get my work done however,
        so don't expect me to be on much outside of voice calls while I'm working on stuff.
        <br><br>
        Also, I will try to get a photo of the blog on the PDA later today if I am on my laptop.
        No promises however. How do yall like the CSS update so far? I hope it was worth it, even if
        it isn't much.

      <p class='title'>Ill with RSV and Site Update</p>

        Those who know me on Discord should know that I've been ill with RSV, 
        (Respiratory System Virus) for the past 4-5 days. It's been pretty annoying
        but now I've reached a state that I can go back to school, so that's nice.
        <br><br>
        Anyways, this page has received a slight touch as you can see. I'm having a go
        at messing with CSS (Cascasing Style Sheets) again, hopefully it doesn't
        impact the visibility on my PDA.
        <br><br>
        EDIT: A PDA is a Pocket PC, I am not referring to the term "Public Display of Affection".<br>
        EDIT EDIT: Maybe next update I'll share a photo of the blog on my PDA <3

        Last night I checked my text messages to find that my girlfriend, 
        who shall not be named for privacy, had broke up with me. 
        This brought down my mood a bit, but I'm trying to remain neutral 
        to not put worry into others. As I'm typing this, I have started 
        work on making a blog page for <a href='https://maril.dev'>maril.dev</a>, in which 
        itself is still a placeholder.
        <br><br>
        EDIT:<br>
        I'm not sure how I'll handle making blog entries, as right now everything is done
        in raw HTML over at <a href="https://github.com/supeki/maril.dev">https://github.com/supeki/maril.dev</a>.<br>If you have any ideas, <a href="contacts.html">please get in contact with me.</a>
