      <p>
        Last night I checked my text messages to find that my girlfriend, 
        who shall not be named for privacy, had broke up with me. 
        This brought down my mood a bit, but I'm trying to remain neutral 
        to not put worry into others. As I'm typing this, I have started 
        work on making a blog page for <a href='https://maril.dev'>maril.dev</a>, in which 
        itself is still a placeholder.
        <br><br>
        EDIT:<br>
        I'm not sure how I'll handle making blog entries, as right now everything is done
        in raw HTML over at <a href="https://github.com/supeki/maril.dev">https://github.com/supeki/maril.dev</a>.<br>If you have any ideas, <a href="mailto:speccykitsune@gmail.com">please do send me an email.</a>
