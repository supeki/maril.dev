        I've currently fallen behind in my studies in school, but I am slowly catching up.
        I'll need to stay away from Discord and Twitter long enough to actually get my work done however,
        so don't expect me to be on much outside of voice calls while I'm working on stuff.
        <br><br>
        Also, I will try to get a photo of the blog on the PDA later today if I am on my laptop.
        No promises however. How do yall like the CSS update so far? I hope it was worth it, even if
        it isn't much.

        Those who know me on Discord should know that I've been ill with RSV, 
        (Respiratory System Virus) for the past 4-5 days. It's been pretty annoying
        but now I've reached a state that I can go back to school, so that's nice.
        <br><br>
        Anyways, this page has received a slight touch as you can see. I'm having a go
        at messing with CSS (Cascasing Style Sheets) again, hopefully it doesn't
        impact the visibility on my PDA.
        <br><br>
        EDIT: A PDA is a Pocket PC, I am not referring to the term "Public Display of Affection".<br>
        EDIT EDIT: Maybe next update I'll share a photo of the blog on my PDA <3

        Last night I checked my text messages to find that my girlfriend, 
        who shall not be named for privacy, had broke up with me. 
        This brought down my mood a bit, but I'm trying to remain neutral 
        to not put worry into others. As I'm typing this, I have started 
        work on making a blog page for <a href='https://maril.dev'>maril.dev</a>, in which 
        itself is still a placeholder.
        <br><br>
        EDIT:<br>
        I'm not sure how I'll handle making blog entries, as right now everything is done
        in raw HTML over at <a href="https://github.com/supeki/maril.dev">https://github.com/supeki/maril.dev</a>.<br>If you have any ideas, <a href="contacts.html">please get in contact with me.</a>
