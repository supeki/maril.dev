        We're almost done with the school year, and my final year in high school. Going back to school in-person for my senior year was both a hard choice to make, but also one that was worth it. Soon I'll be going into basic training through the Navy, and then my 2 year A school. I may no longer be able to make updates, but I wish everyone who's been around me has a good time. I plan to release one more blog update before I go into basic training, so I'll see yall then. Hopefully I can push out an update to the main page too before then.

        Well, scratch out that CWT job with the Navy, and replace it with NUC. I got the job in Nuclear Engineering, however I feel down. I don't want to disclose why I'm down, but I'm down.

        To put it shrimple, my life is awkward and weird. I think I need to take as long a break as I can from any major social platforms outside of IRC, and private messaging with certain individuals.
        <br><br>
        I have enlisted in the US Navy as a Cyber Warfare Technician in hopes of being able to figure out my future. Hopefully I'll be able to get a good degree in the Navy that will help if I choose to leave the Navy after 8 years.

        Speccy v2 is going good, here's a video of it.<br>

        I think I've lost it. I've lost it all. I would like to apologize to my dearest friend, Orion, who's been there for me for the longest time.
        You do not deserve me, no one deserves me. 
        <br><br>
        I think I should also mention that I've lost another friend of mine. His name was Ethan Hargrave. He killed himself in the afternoon of the first of the month.
        I was not notified until a full day after it happened, and only because my parents were told by my sister who was told by her friend who was told by her MUN peers.
        <br><br>
        I would like to apologize to my community for having to deal with me while I was slowly going insane the past few days, and I would like to apologize to everyone that I have
        upset. I need a break, a really long break, one that might even change me entirely as a person moving on in life. I still love you Orion, but I need to move on I guess... go be happy with that other person.
        <br><br>
        As for my projects, for those of you that follow me for that. Those are not cancelled, they will be shadow dropped one day I suppose. But there will be no more updates until they're out.
        <br><br>
        To ensure my goodbye, I am deleting my Discord account, and I am no longer interacting on Twitter. I will still be in #srb2fun for a while, it's small and comfy... but I will not be in any large places, or in much a mood to talk.
        <br>Maril out.

        Tomorrow will mark the 15th or 16th year of my younger step-brother Aiden's life. I haven't seen him in a long while
        but I wish him well. I'll likely call him tomorrow, but I think I won't have much to say other than Happy Birthday.
        <br><br>
        Anyways, life has been going interesting, for better or worse. I've made a new Speccy model, which is based off my previous
        model, but now with a few optimizations and actual bendable tails and a better armature. I plan to use this
        model for any new projects of mine, as well as replacing the sprites in a few older projects. I would like to thank
        LonelyFoxz for teaching me this new stuff I used to make the model, including mirroring and symmetrization.
        <br><br>
        Lonely (or Foxz [?]) has also been helping with one of my larger projects, Robo Blast Online. A theoretical multiplayer
        RPG game based off Phantasy Star Online, being made in Sonic Robo Blast 2. He's made the model and animations for
        Sonic, including a unique sword design that looks similar to an emblem! So I have a lot of thanks to give to him
        as well as Bolt Zyphyr for helping contribute to the project. It wouldn't be anywhere without them, even if we've
        just started...
        <br><br>
        Here's an image of the new model, it's hosted on Discord, so if it disappears, let me know.<br>

        I've currently fallen behind in my studies in school, but I am slowly catching up.
        I'll need to stay away from Discord and Twitter long enough to actually get my work done however,
        so don't expect me to be on much outside of voice calls while I'm working on stuff.
        <br><br>
        Also, I will try to get a photo of the blog on the PDA later today if I am on my laptop.
        No promises however. How do yall like the CSS update so far? I hope it was worth it, even if
        it isn't much.

      <p class='title'>Ill with RSV and Site Update</p>

        Those who know me on Discord should know that I've been ill with RSV, 
        (Respiratory System Virus) for the past 4-5 days. It's been pretty annoying
        but now I've reached a state that I can go back to school, so that's nice.
        <br><br>
        Anyways, this page has received a slight touch as you can see. I'm having a go
        at messing with CSS (Cascasing Style Sheets) again, hopefully it doesn't
        impact the visibility on my PDA.
        <br><br>
        EDIT: A PDA is a Pocket PC, I am not referring to the term "Public Display of Affection".<br>
        EDIT EDIT: Maybe next update I'll share a photo of the blog on my PDA <3

        Last night I checked my text messages to find that my girlfriend, 
        who shall not be named for privacy, had broke up with me. 
        This brought down my mood a bit, but I'm trying to remain neutral 
        to not put worry into others. As I'm typing this, I have started 
        work on making a blog page for <a href='https://maril.dev'>maril.dev</a>, in which 
        itself is still a placeholder.
        <br><br>
        EDIT:<br>
        I'm not sure how I'll handle making blog entries, as right now everything is done
        in raw HTML over at <a href="https://github.com/supeki/maril.dev">https://github.com/supeki/maril.dev</a>.<br>If you have any ideas, <a href="contacts.html">please get in contact with me.</a>
